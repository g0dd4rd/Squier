TODO:
[x] player should die after a while of missing notes or not playing #done
[ ] use JSON files for levels
[ ] add beats
[ ] should player get points for hitting a note more than once?
[ ] think more about level properties (min. score for a level, sound/graphics effects...)
[ ] create game editor 
[ ] let people create levels and share them with others
[ ] let people rate their levels
[x] add left/right movement #done
[ ] goal of the game is to remain human

Suggestions:
Tylak:
[ ] maybe at the start of the game you could show a graphic of the keyboard keys overlayed on piano keys

cidic:
[x] need big text telling user their speakers must be on

QF-MichaelK:
[ ] rotate the Entire thing, it feels sideways since the keyboard is left to right, the movement is up/down
[ ] increase the speed a bit
[ ] put an outline around the "main" rectangle of a different color because sometimes the backgrounds sort of obscure it
[ ] would be neat to have particle effects too

Sk3letor:
[ ] make the sounds less painful

llamapixel
[x] add key/note description to each sq. representing one
[ ] remove ^ in harder levels
