TODO:
- player should die after a while of missing notes or not playing
- should player get points for hitting a note more than once?
- think more about level properties (min. score for a level, sound/graphics effects...)
- create game editor 
- let people create levels and share them with others
- let people rate their levels
- add left/right movement
- goal of the game is to remain human
